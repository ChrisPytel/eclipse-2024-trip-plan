# Plan B

Check traffic with google maps to confirm if there alot of people queing for parking at Dundas peak trail parking.

If we arrive at Tews falls and parking is really packed we can can do Synderham point for the actual eclipse viewing, THEN do hiking trail after totality happens.

## Notes

- Check weather  (11 degrees and mix of sun and clouds so far)
- Get GO train tickets / prestocard sorted out ahead of time
- Maybe worth to bring an umbrella
- Maybe some trail snacks too
- Wear something warmer than seasonal, for 3 hours the temperature will drop and its still early April
- Hiking boots
<!-- - Remind Gaby that she said Aldershart LOL -->
